<h1>Knowledge before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a></h1>
<main>I asked gemini, "what is knowledge before science called?"</main>

<article>
  <h2>Answers from gemini and a dash of copilot:</h2>
<p>Knowledge that existed before the development of modern science, with its emphasis on systematic observation, experimentation, and the scientific method, is often referred to by several terms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>        
      <strong>Traditional Knowledge (TK):</strong>
      
      <p>This is a broad term encompassing the accumulated wisdom, practices, and beliefs developed by communities over long periods, often passed down orally through generations. It includes areas like traditional medicine, ethnobotany, celestial navigation, and sustainable land management.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Indigenous Knowledge (IK):</strong> 
      
      <p> This term specifically refers to the knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples, often deeply tied to their specific environments, cultures, and spiritual beliefs. It is a vital and dynamic body of knowledge that continues to evolve.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Folk Knowledge/Wisdom:</strong> 
      
      <p> This refers to practical knowledge and beliefs shared within a community or culture, often based on common sense, experience, and anecdotal evidence, without rigorous scientific testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Empirical Knowledge:</strong>
      <p>This term refers to knowledge gained through observation and experience rather than through scientific methods. It includes practical skills and techniques developed through trial and error over generations.</p> 
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Pre-scientific knowledge:</strong>
      
      <p>This is a more general descriptive term that simply indicates knowledge existing before the scientific era.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <strong>Natural Philosophy:</strong>
    
    <p>Historically, before the specialized fields of "science" emerged, the study of nature and the physical world was largely part of philosophy. Thinkers like Aristotle engaged in "natural philosophy" to understand the world through observation and reason, even if their methods weren't what we recognize as the scientific method today.</p> 
    </li>    
    </ul>

<p>These forms of knowledge, while different from modern science in their methodology and epistemological foundations, were crucial for human survival, cultural development, and understanding the world for millennia. They often contain valuable insights and practices that are now being recognized and integrated with scientific approaches, particularly in fields like environmental conservation and medicine.</p>
